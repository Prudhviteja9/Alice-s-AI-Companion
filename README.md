# Alice-s-AI-Companion
# Conversational Agent for "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"

This project utilizes Google Cloudâ€™s Dialogflow to create a conversational agent capable of discussing "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll. The agent responds to user queries by providing detailed, citation-backed answers, and supports both text and voice-based interactions.

## Project Overview

The conversational agent leverages Dialogflow's advanced NLU capabilities to interpret and respond to user inquiries related to the book. It is designed to enhance user engagement with literature through interactive technology, providing an accessible platform for exploring classic texts.

### Key Features

- **Text and Voice Interactions:** Enables users to interact through a web interface or via a phone gateway.
- **Datastore Integration:** Utilizes an indexed datastore for quick retrieval of book contents.
- **Citation-backed Responses:** Delivers responses with references to specific passages in the book.

## System Architecture

The project is structured into several components to handle different aspects of the conversational interface:

- **User Interface:** Manages user inputs and displays responses.
- **Dialogflow Platform:** Processes and interprets user input using NLU.
- **Indexed Datastore:** Contains the entire text of "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland."
- **Response Logic Layer:** Maps queries to relevant book content and generates responses.
- **Dialogflow Phone Gateway:** Facilitates voice interactions by converting speech to text and vice versa.
- **End User Output:** Presents processed information to the user in text or spoken form.
